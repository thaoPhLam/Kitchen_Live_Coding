# Kitchen_Live_Coding
Practice for PA

You received a task to model a restaurant’s kitchen. 
Restaurants have cooks, one chef, and kitchen helpers. 
Plan and create classes based on the following requirements:

- Store every employee's name, birth date, and salary.
- All employees are able to create their tax report based on their salary. 
  Print out the tax they should pay which is 99% of their salary.
- Chefs and cooks can cook.
    - When a chef cooks, she doesn’t touch anything, but yells constantly
    - Ordinary cooks dirt their hands and get the job done
- Kitchen helpers have 3 types of ingredients with them: carrot, potato or meat (0-3 pieces of each at random).
- When the chef yells, in some cases she asks for an ingredient from the kitchen helpers. 
  The first kitchen helper who has that ingredient should give the chef one piece. 
  If none of them have any they should all yell “We’re all out”.
- The restaurant provides good quality knife sets for cooks and chefs but only once (somewhere after they got employed). 
  We should store if the cook/chef received his/her knife set
Hints: You should have an abstract class, use inheritance, data hiding and make sure there is no code repetition.
